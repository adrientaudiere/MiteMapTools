\title{Rename files with number inside a folder}
\usage{
rename_files_with_number(path_to_folder, keep_original = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_to_folder}{(required) Path to folder}

\item{keep_original}{(logical, default FALSE). Do we keep zip_files with
parenthesis in the name?}
}
\value{
Nothing. Only modify files in a folder.
}
\description{
MiteMap software may export zip files with parenthesis and space in the name
(for example "My file (1).zip", which can be problematic.
This function rename files by adding the number inside the parenthesis
before the extension (for example "My_file_1.zip"). It also rename the files
inside the zip file to avoid confusion. Note that the name of the csv inside
a zip file with a parenthesis do not have parenthesis into this name. This
function add the number at the end of the csv file in order to match to
the zip file name.

If \code{keep_original} is TRUE, the original zip files with parenthesis are kept.

Note that this renaming must be also done in the metadata files when using
the \code{\link[=import_mitemap]{import_mitemap()}} function.
