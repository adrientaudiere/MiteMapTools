\usage{
binom_test_mitemap(
  MiteMap,
  factor = NULL,
  format = "HH",
  verbose = TRUE,
  p.adjust_method = "BH",
  level = "run",
  alternative = "two.sided"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{MiteMap}{(required) The result of import_mitemap}

\item{factor}{(required, default NULL) The column name to separate individuals
in the MiteMap data frame (e.g., "Treatment").}

\item{format}{(default "HH") The format of \code{left} area. "HH" for Half-Half,
"CH" for Circular-Half.}

\item{verbose}{(Logical, default = TRUE) If TRUE, the function print additional
information.}

\item{p.adjust_method}{(default "BH") method for p-adjustement.
See \code{\link[stats:p.adjust]{stats::p.adjust()}}.}

\item{level}{(default "run") The level of analysis. "run" to consider each run
(File_name) as one replicate. "lines" to consider each line
(i.e. each temporal point) of MiteMap as one replicate. The level run is
more conservative as it considers that each run is one independent replicate.
Use level "lines" carefully as it introduce a high pseudoreplication risk.}

\item{alternative}{(default "two.sided") The alternative hypothesis to test.
See \code{\link[stats:binom.test]{stats::binom.test()}}.}

\description{
Test binomial on MiteMap for presence in the half part of the odor
}
\details{
The test is run for each factor values with a p-adjustement step. For each
run (filename), the proportion of points in the left half is calculated. If the
proportion is superior to 0.5, the run is considered as "in left", else "in right".
Then a binomial test is run to test if the proportion of runs "in left" is
significantly different from 0.5 for each levels of the factor. If format is "CH",
the same process is done but for presence in the circular half rather than
a half part.

If level is "lines", each line of MiteMap is considered as one replicate
(i.e. the proportion of points in left half is calculated for each line of MiteMap).
This approach is not recommended as it introduce a high pseudoreplication risk.
